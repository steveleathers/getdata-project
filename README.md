Course Project for getdata-009

# Important notes
All files should be extracted from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  and put into root directory. 
This script does not take into account the directory structure of getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip
This was done not only for simplicity's sake, but also to keep graders on their toes.

The dataset that results from this script is rather wide. Consider yourself forewarned.

# Project Description

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
